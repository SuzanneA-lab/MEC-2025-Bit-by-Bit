                <h3> What Is It?</h3>
                <p>
                    A wildfire is an uncontrolled fire that burn through natural fuels, and is able to spread quickly.
                    They can occur in forests, in grasslands, in rural farmlands, as well as any dry ecosystem. <br>
                    <br>
                    Three ingredients are needed for a wildfire to ignite: 
                    <ul>
                        <li> Fuel</li>
                        <li> Heat</li>
                        <li> Oxygen</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                <h3>How Does It Happen?</h3>
                <p>
                    The perfect fuel for wildfires consists of dried materials like branches, leaves and grass, which can ignite instantly and burn quickly.
                    Other factors, such as weather conditions, (including drought and wind), can increase the chances of a fire starting and increase its intensity.
                    A natural ignition source for wildfires is lightning.
                </p>

                <h3>How Can I Prepare?</h3>
                <p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Monitor the weather, and stay alert during the dry seasons</li>
                        <li>Know all evacuation routes, and practice evacuation protocol</li>
                    </ul>
