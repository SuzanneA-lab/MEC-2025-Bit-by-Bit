                <h3> What Is It?</h3>
                <p>
                    Energy in Earth’s crust is released in many different forms, such as: 
                     <ul>
                        <li>Heat</li> 
                        <li>Seismic waves</li>
                        <li>Movement along fractures in Earth’s crust</li>  
                     </ul>
                     This release of energy causes the ground to shake, which then leads to the damage of buildigns and homes. 
                </p>
                <!--write info about disaster in here!-->
                <h3>How Does It Happen?</h3>
                <p>
                    Earth is made up of numerous tectonic plates that constantly move.
                    Where the rough and uneven edges of the plates meet, friction is create between each other.  
                    Sometimes the plates can get stuck, and stress builds up over time. When this happens, too much stress between the tectonic plates can cause them to break suddenly, releasing energy to become an earthquake.
                </p>

                <h3>How Can I Prepare?</h3>
                <p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sign up for local earthquake alerts</li>
                        <li>Practice evacuation procedures</li>
                        <li>Ensure emergency kit is stocked and up to date</li>
                    </ul>
